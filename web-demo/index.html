				<b>Why should I do this?</b>

				<p>
					First and foremost, if you're trying to get better at technical interviews, the best
					way to do that is to actually do it. Here, you can get a lens into the kinds of
					questions you'd encounter at top companies and get comfortable with answering them
					in a low-pressure, anonymous setting.<br/><br/>

					Beyond that, interviewing here can be a great way to get your feet in the door at
					top companies.
				</p>

				<b>Can I get interviewed by someone I work with? Because that'd be awkward.</b>

				<p>
					Nope! We'll make sure you're only paired with people you're not connected to.
				</p>

				<b>Do I have to be looking for a job to use this?</b>
			
				<p>
					Absolutely not. Whether you're here to see if you've still got it after
					being out of the game for a while or whether you just like solving problems
					with strangers or any number of reasons, we're happy you're here.
				</p>

				<b>How anonymous is this really?</b>

				<p>
					Interviews have voice but no video, and your interviewe will not have
					access to any of your info. In other words, how much you reveal is
					entirely up to you. Moreover, we will never share anything about you
					or your contact info with anyone without your permission.
